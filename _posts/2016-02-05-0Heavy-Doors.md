Below the surface of a moonlit lake, Seshat turns on white opal hinges. She is its reflection.

The traveler will reach the lake many times in his journeys. Standing on the shore, he sees Seshat twofold: the ivory door standing in front of him, and its mirror underneath. The choice is always the same: to grab the pearl doorknob in front of him or to sink into the bitter, gelid water and stare at stand upon Seshat’s judgment.

In his youthful innocence, she will open smoothly, allowing him to cross the threshold unscathed. In adolescent trials, the traveler will submit to temptation and cross the door above, avoiding the water. Each time the traveler eludes the lake, Seshat’s white taints, darkens. The hinges, stained, will resist its turning.

Should the man, tired of his voyage, choose Seshat-above again and again, its reflection will blacken. She will be lost in the in the water and never open again.

The wise will always choose to brace the cold, even if their voices tremble, for nothing good lies on the other side of the surface door.
