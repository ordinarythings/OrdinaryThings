Acclara was never open and it will never be. Yet as the bonfire smoke rose up in the early morning sky, a word made it ajar. In superposition, Acclara was open and closed at the same time. Those who saw what was inside may never erase it from their memories: an image tainted, a life destroyed. The affected had no choice but to flee. Touched, but not damaged, they picked up their belongings and put down their tents. Amidst the timberland only the carcasses of the night remained. The beer cans and crimson cups. The shattered glass bottles, their fragments gleaming like teardrops shed at night.

The firewood was gone, depleted, but the fire kept burning. Fueled by words, by lies, by bodies against each other like bandages masking open wounds. Some gashes will never heal.

In a journey with no end, the pilgrim will seek to close Acclara, bolt her shut for eternity. But like a virus, her effect will find its way to spread from man to man. Only to those who choose to live in ignorance will she remain closed. The Zephyr of time will bury Acclara in the minds of all but one: he whose identity was broken by the darkness that lies within her.
