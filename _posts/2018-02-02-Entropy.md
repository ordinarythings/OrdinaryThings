My phone buzzed on my lap, almost unnoticed at the crowded restaurant, pulling me out of a conversation and into a memory.

Sneaking out of a hotel room again. The city was wrong, but the motivation the same. The white envelope felt heavy in my hands as they fumbled with the mailbox outside the elevator.

I watched the letter fall like coffee stirs from the roof of a convention center, floating down and finding comfort in the Cali green. Soon it would be gone like she was.

I told myself I wouldn't let her go, next time, but when the whirrs and whistles stopped, she was lost in entropy.

The blue-red lights dimmed and I let the clatter of the restaurant fill me again. I looked down at the screen, hesitant.

"It went alright, I guess. We went to the movies. But I could only think of you."
