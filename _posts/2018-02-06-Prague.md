Under the fluorescent Prague moon, she moved like a raindrop. Graceful, yet steady, resolute in her destination. 

She was the whistling whisper of the wind against the ocean, her lips on my ear carrying a faithless word: "Madeline."

She was the clouds of a hazy overcast sky, a reverie of fantasy and fact. Regal, yet True when I earned her name.

Each word was a chisel that shaped my form and desire. Her strokes crafted a suit for a knight, but the man beneath it rusted with the winter's chill. 

She grew quiet like a song without an ending, fading into silence, waiting for a solstice yet to come.
