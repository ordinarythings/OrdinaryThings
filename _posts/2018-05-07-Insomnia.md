"I like sad things," she told me outside the needle shop.

Her skin glowed like graffiti, making art without meaning. And I? I was another drag of her lips, another dart between her fingers.

We walked through the parking lot. Each step careful, mellow like the April rain. The night was our darkroom and we unfolded. In the overexposed film our features sharpened, our hands grazed, and our thoughts diluted. I breathed in what was left of her timbre and watched her walk home.

Alone I looked at her picture on my phone. I remembered the tremble in her skin when she'd asked to see me again. I remembered the fit of her nose on mine. And as I fell into Insomnia, I remembered the life I'd given away for her black heart.
