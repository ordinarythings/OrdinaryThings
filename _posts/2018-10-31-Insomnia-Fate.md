We sat under the neon lights of a tattoo shop, waiting. My hand in hers amplified the bustling silence of traffic on the road behind us. Raindrops, like the keys of a jealous church organ, muffled the already fading timbres of the concert.

Her skin glowed like graffiti, making art without meaning. In the night—her darkroom—overexposed, we unfolded. She said she was nervous. I was too; but the sharp fit of her nose on mine made my thoughts dilute, like water and cold coffee. I forgot then the time I wasn't allured by the glamorous shroud of winter.

Transient, like the drag of a cigarette, she filled my lungs with sweet timber. I breathed what was left of her as she walked away, shedding mellow steps home, and exhaled into insomnia.
