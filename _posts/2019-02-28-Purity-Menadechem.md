“I want you to fuck me in front of the Talmud, she says.

“Is that like, your thing?” I ask.

“I just want to try it. Might be hot.” It’s her thing.

I look around her apartment. Except for the olive couch, and the almost-made bed I can glimpse through an ajar door, her bland furniture is covered with black leather-bound books. The yellow light of a cheap lamp reflects off the golden Hebrew letters on each spine. 

I smile, bite my lip, and nod. Perfect. Suggestive, but not too eager. Sure, I’ll do it.

After, she looks at me and I wonder if it's the first time. “Were you comfortable with everything tonight?” she asks before passing out, “I mean, I know we were both a little drunk.” De-briefing is my favourite part, and this is a good one. “Where have you been all my life?” It builds me up. Isn’t that why we're here? One text to fulfill a fantasy, to be an object by choice, for once, and let someone use you for their desire.

How did people do it before the smartphone? Before a swipe meant the difference between a night alone, or one pretending to love a stranger until, like turning off a hot shower, the urge to go home overtakes, and I leave her sleeping, looking back with a smile that is almost intimate, and close the door behind me.

I stand in front of a yoga studio waiting for my Lyft. It’s 3 in the morning and I’m freezing. I’d left the party wearing a coat of gin and libido. Both gone, I rush inside the car as it slows down. I finally check my phone. I swipe away most notifications and unlock the screen. Her profile is still open, from the way over. In the picture, she wears a long red dress. On someone else it might look racy; shadowed by her soft smile and dark green, ice-cream eyes, it looks innocent. I debate texting her. “Goodnight! See ya soon.” Too desperate. “I'm glad you asked me over!” Too cute. She just wants something casual, so I'm careful. I check the app instead: 10 more minutes and I'll be home. When I get there, I'll sit at my desk and watch YouTube videos. I'll slow down my thoughts, exhaling, as much as I can take before falling asleep. I push down the urge to cry. I can't cry in a Lyft, or I'll become memorable. I'll be the-guy-who-broke-down-in-his-car-once. I want to be just another passenger. I want him to forget me, so I chat about rap.

Ride-sharing changed everything for us. A couple taps and I'm on my way to the other side of the city. It's like a videogame after finishing the tutorial, the lust of an open-world -- its dangers and thrills -- to explore at our leisure. It feels anonymous: each ride blends into the next, drivers and shared passengers become blurs, like the parties we go to every weekend -- all the same. Back home I look for remains of this week’s party: people playing drinking games or coming back from late-night food. Anything to not be alone. But it’s quiet, now, every door but mine closed. My lights are on, and my speaker beeps as it finds my phone again. I climb onto my bed and feel the cold, sticky plastic of the bare mattress against my thighs. Damn it. I forgot to put sheets back on my bed after doing laundry. I consider my options and finally grab a blanket and lie down on my couch. I’ll worry about the sheets tomorrow. 

For a second, before I fall asleep, as my eyes start to close and my fists clench at the blanket, I let my mind loose to wrap herself around her. In the dark, she holds her hand, brushes her hair, and kisses her sweet dreams. She loves her. And she lets her go. Then she comes back to me. I clench my fists harder, and the shaking starts.
