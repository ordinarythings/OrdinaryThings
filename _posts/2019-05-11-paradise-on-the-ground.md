We saw them in the afterglow of a withering festival. Something about them didn't seem right. I thought maybe we were caught in the tumult of the last night. Ruminating on the gunshots, the awful shrieks, and the sound of a body falling limp on steps you've walked on. But still, something just didn't look right. Maybe it was the way she stood in his penumbra, or how his arm caught her between him and the brick wall. I whispered to you about it. We hesitated. Were we a few minutes from a few minutes too late?

You saw it too. "He could beat you up," you whispered back. We crossed the street and stood beside them, holding hands. He fidgeted. "Yo-can we help you. We're good here." I held my phone up, I didn't say a word. I was too scared to. A car drove by us, slowing down. She bolted inside it. I've never seen anyone run that fast. We turned back and he was gone.

It looked like it might rain. We went home and I forgot of them. I didn't think about it for months. A year later, I started seeing them in dreams. I woke up in tears, but I felt light. The gardens shriveled, the festival music paused in wonder, and we didn't come back next year. But we crossed that road -- maybe that was enough?
