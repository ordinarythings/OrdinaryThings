We saw them in the afterglow of a withering festival. Something about them didn't seem right. I thought maybe we were caught in the tumult of last night. Ruminating on the gunshots, the awful shriek of someone who could have been you, and the sound of their body falling limp on steps you've walked on. But still something didn't look right. Maybe it was the way she stood in his penumbra, or how his arm caught her between him and the brick wall. I whispered something about it. We hesitated. Were we a few minutes from a few minutes too late?

She saw it too. "He could beat you up," she whispered back.  We crossed the street and stood beside them, holding hands. He fidgeted. "Yo, can we help you. We're good here." I held my phone up and didn't say a word. I was too scared to. A car drove by us, slowing down. She bolted inside it. I've never seen anyone run that fast. We turned back and he was gone.

It looked like it might rain. We went home and I forgot all about it. I didn't think on it for months. A year later, I started seeing them in dreams.  I woke up in tears, but I felt light. The gardens withered in rows, the festival music paused in wonder, and we didn't come back next year. But we crossed that road -- maybe that was enough?
